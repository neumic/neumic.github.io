#What this is
This is my personal web stuff.  Most of the interesting stuff right now is in
the resume, but that's going to change here real soon like.

#What you can do with it
The site is built off of h5bp/html5-boilerplate which is released under the MIT
license.  I'll follow suit and release the css and html that I've modified and
extended under that same license ( and I'll link to it here when I get around to
it. )  Any images or other content are not free at the moment, and until I get
them all sorted out, please refrain from using them without asking.

That's all folks.  Go look at some more interesting repo.
